## 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in understanding the data before diving into deeper analytics or visualization. In this section, I aimed to **extract patterns**, **identify anomalies**, and **establish meaningful relationships** within the Uber Fares dataset.

---

### 🔹 a. Descriptive Statistics

I began by calculating **summary statistics** for key numerical columns such as `fare_amount`, `distance`, and `trip_duration`.

**Purpose & Reasoning:**

* **Mean, Median, Mode**:
  Help us understand the central tendencies. While the **mean** gives the average fare, the **median** helps reduce the effect of outliers, and **mode** identifies the most frequent fare values.

<img width="1059" height="81" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 112019" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b30b34-f586-4786-9530-f5f3eca0aaaa" />



* **Standard Deviation**:
  Indicates how much fare values vary. A high standard deviation might suggest fare inconsistencies or a wide variety of trip types (e.g., short vs. long distance).

* **Quartiles and Range**:
 used these to divide data into four parts and assess fare distributions. Knowing the **interquartile range (IQR)** helped in outlier detection and understanding where most values are concentrated.

  <img width="1102" height="167" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 112325" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5757ae1-a536-45df-b37d-b6480f156c2e" />


* **Outlier Detection**:
  Identifying unusually high or low fares helped clean the data and ensure a realistic analysis. For instance, fares below \$2 or above \$200 were flagged and reviewed.

<img width="1096" height="30" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 113201" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/839632c8-74df-4811-a6c2-16c536266436" />

---

### 📈 b. Fare Distribution Visualizations

To visually explore the fare patterns, I created multiple plots such as:

* **Histograms**:
  Used to see how fares are distributed across all trips. We discovered that most fares fall between \$5 and \$25.

* **Box Plots**:
  Box plots were effective in identifying **outliers** and understanding **spread** in the data. They clearly visualized the range of fares and how they were skewed

* **Density Plots / KDE Plots** *(optional)*:
  Provided a smoothed curve that represents fare concentration, giving us insights into where the data is densely packed.
  <img width="1153" height="392" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 113546" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c09815df-f70b-4c29-ae2c-0496f429edc5" />


These visualizations helped us **understand the frequency** and **distribution** of fare amounts at a glance.

#### 🔸 Fare Amount vs. Distance Traveled

* **Why**: Distance is directly proportional to fare in most cases.
* **What we found**: There was a **positive linear relationship**, validating the dataset’s consistency.

* <img width="843" height="453" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 122242" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750ae2f6-01fd-41a6-af9c-6974d7d0bceb" />


#### 🔸 Fare Amount vs. Time of Day

* **Why**: Uber fares may vary based on peak/off-peak hours.
* **What we found**: Slight increases in average fare amounts during rush hours, particularly mornings (7–9 AM) and evenings (5–7 PM).

  <img width="1102" height="451" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 122311" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3c84158-3ee1-43fe-a82c-9ca371938e0f" />


#### 🔸 Other Relevant Correlations

* We explored relationships such as:

  * **Pickup vs. Drop-off locations**: To identify hot zones (used later for map visualizations).
 
    <img width="1136" height="534" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-23 122321" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa835481-f1cb-4312-866d-b321c537d652" />

    
  * **Day of week vs. Fare amount**: To understand weekly demand trends.

  * **Trip duration vs. Fare**: To evaluate if longer durations always meant higher fares (not always, due to traffic delays or fixed rates).
  
---

### 🎯 Outcome of EDA

The insights drawn from EDA guided our:

* **Data cleaning rules**
* **Feature engineering (like creating `trip_duration`, `hour`, and `day_name`)**
* **Dashboard design (what variables to highlight and compare)**

EDA laid a **strong foundation** for modeling and dashboard creation in Power BI.
